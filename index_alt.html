          Drew is a senior majoring in Cybersecurity at the University of South Florida. 
          He was born and raised in Tampa, so all he's ever known is 
          sunshine, beaches, and palm trees. Aside from pursuing his education, 
          Drew enjoys collecting vintage clothes, reading, 
          and working on cars. When he graduates, he hopes to find himself working 
          at some tech start-up utilizing the knowledge he's gained while also working 
          to create an online business selling clothes.
